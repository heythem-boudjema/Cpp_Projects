# ATM System

This project simulates an ATM system from the
user’s perspective. It allows bank customers
to log in and perform basic banking operations
through an ATM interface.

## Features

- User login
- Balance inquiry
- Cash deposit
- Cash withdrawal
- Input validation and basic error handling

## Description

The ATM system represents the customer-facing
side of a banking system. It is designed to work
independently from the admin system and focuses
on simplicity and clarity of logic.

This project demonstrates:
- Control flow and menu-based systems
- File handling
- Separation of responsibilities
- Real-world banking workflow simulation

## How to Run

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ atm.cpp -o atm

## Integration Note

This ATM system is linked to version 2 of the Bank System project.
It depends on client data stored in the v2 project files.
